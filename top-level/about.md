<div id="about">
  <p>My name is Cody Taylor.  I identify as both a librarian and as an engineer  â€“the former by practice, the latter by training. Presently, I am an [Emerging Technologies Librarian](https://libraries.ou.edu) at the [University of Oklahoma](https://ou.edu) -also where I studied Electrical Engineering.  Professionally, I develop [Open Educational Resources](https://open.ou.edu), manage a [makerspace](https://libraries.ou.edu/edge), and consult with the University community in hopes of improving learning outcomes, pedagogy, and research via honest technology implementations. Personally, I have many interests; tinkering, electronics, microcontrollers, coding, web development, and all things open-source.</p>
