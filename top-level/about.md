# About

My name is Cody Taylor.  I am trained as an electrical engineer and I am a practicing  emerging technologies librarian at University of Oklahoma Libraries.  I spend a significant portion of my time supporting and developing open educational resources (OER).  The remainder, and largest portion of my time, is spent supporting Innovation @ the Edge, a makerspace in the Bizzell Memorial Library on the OU campus.  I enjoy exploring innovative ways of publishing OER, STEAM education, prototyping anything, and toying with code.
