  <p>My name is Cody Taylor.  I am an [Emerging Technologies Librarian](https://libraries.ou.edu) at the [University of Oklahoma](https://ou.edu). Professionally, I develop [Open Educational Resources](https://open.ou.edu), manage a [makerspace](https://libraries.ou.edu/edge), and consult with the University community in hopes of improving learning outcomes, pedagogy, and research via honest technology implementations. I'm interested in electrical engineering, microcontrollers, coding, web development, and all things open-source.</p>
